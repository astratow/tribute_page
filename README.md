# tribute_page<BR>
Tribute page for freeCodeCamp.org<br>
I created the tribute_page as a freeCodeCamp.org project for Responsive Website Certification.<br>
I am learning PHP now, so I converted it to be run on the server as PHP file. I put <code>echo</code> function around the content and I had to change quote marks to ensure it all works. Not much work, but it is another step up! <br>
Have a good day!
