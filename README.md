# tribute_page
Tribute page for freeCodeCamp.org
I created the tribute_page as a freeCodeCamp.org project for Responsive Website Certification.
I am learning PHP now, so I converted it to be run on the server as PHP file. I put echo function around the content and I had to change quote marks to ensure it all works. Not much work, but it is another step up! 
Have a good day!
